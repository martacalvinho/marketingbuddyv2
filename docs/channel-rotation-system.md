# Marketing Channel Rotation System

## The Problem You Identified ✅

**You:** "3 directories and 3 communities is too little for the long term. Once the user has done each once, there has to be more generated or else it gets useless fast."

**Example:**
- Week 1: List on CoinMarketCap ✅
- Week 2: List on CoinGecko ✅
- Week 3: List on DappRadar ✅
- Week 4: ...now what? 🤷‍♂️

**User thinks:** "I've done everything. This tool is useless now."

---

## The Solution: Expand + Rotate + Evolve

### **1. Comprehensive Initial Research (10-15 per category)**

Instead of 3 directories, AI returns **10-15 with priority levels**:

```json
{
  "directories": [
    // HIGH PRIORITY (Week 1-2) - Must-do, high-impact
    {
      "name": "CoinMarketCap",
      "priority": "high",
      "reasoning": "Largest crypto directory, 100M+ monthly visitors",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "CoinGecko",
      "priority": "high",
      "reasoning": "Second largest, strong community engagement",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "DappRadar",
      "priority": "high",
      "reasoning": "Top dApp discovery platform",
      "estimatedTime": "45 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    
    // MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 3-4) - Important, good ROI
    {
      "name": "DefiLlama",
      "priority": "medium",
      "reasoning": "DeFi-focused, growing audience",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "CryptoCompare",
      "priority": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Data-focused users, API integration",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "State of the Dapps",
      "priority": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Curated dApp directory",
      "estimatedTime": "45 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "CoinCodex",
      "priority": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Price tracking + tool directory",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    
    // LOW PRIORITY (Month 2+) - Nice-to-have, niche audiences
    {
      "name": "Messari",
      "priority": "low",
      "reasoning": "Research-focused, institutional audience",
      "estimatedTime": "60 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "CryptoSlate",
      "priority": "low",
      "reasoning": "News + directory, niche audience",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Blockchain.com Directory",
      "priority": "low",
      "reasoning": "Wallet users discovering tools",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "CoinCheckup",
      "priority": "low",
      "reasoning": "Smaller directory, targeted audience",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Nomics",
      "priority": "low",
      "reasoning": "API-first, developer audience",
      "estimatedTime": "30 min",
      "isRecurring": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** 12 directories = 12 weeks of unique tasks (3 months)

---

### **2. Communities = Recurring Engagement**

Communities aren't one-time - they're **ongoing engagement** with different task types:

```json
{
  "communities": [
    {
      "name": "r/CryptoCurrency",
      "platform": "Reddit",
      "priority": "high",
      "frequency": "weekly",
      "reasoning": "3M+ members, active daily discussions",
      "engagementTypes": [
        "Post about new feature/update",
        "Answer questions in comments",
        "Share market insight with dashboard data",
        "Participate in daily discussion thread",
        "Share user success story",
        "Provide feedback on other tools",
        "Create educational post about crypto tracking"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Crypto Twitter",
      "platform": "Twitter",
      "priority": "high",
      "frequency": "daily",
      "reasoning": "Primary discovery platform for crypto users",
      "engagementTypes": [
        "Post alpha thread about features",
        "Share market insights with screenshots",
        "Engage with crypto influencers",
        "Reply to questions about tracking",
        "Quote tweet relevant discussions",
        "Share user testimonials",
        "Post feature demos"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "r/defi",
      "platform": "Reddit",
      "priority": "high",
      "frequency": "weekly",
      "reasoning": "DeFi-focused community, 500k+ members",
      "engagementTypes": [
        "Post about DeFi tracking features",
        "Answer protocol questions",
        "Share DeFi analytics insights",
        "Participate in protocol discussions"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** Same community, different tasks each week = stays fresh

**Example rotation for r/CryptoCurrency:**
- **Week 1:** Post about launch
- **Week 2:** Answer questions in comments
- **Week 3:** Share market insight
- **Week 4:** Participate in daily discussion
- **Week 5:** Share user success story
- **Week 6:** Create educational post
- **Week 7:** Provide feedback on other tools
- **Week 8:** Back to posting about new feature

### **3. Task Generation Logic**

#### **A. Directory Tasks (One-Time)**

```typescript
function getNextDirectoryTask(user, channelResearch) {
  // Get completed directories
  const completed = user.completedTasks
    .filter(t => t.type === 'directory-listing')
    .map(t => t.directory)
  
  // Get available directories (not completed)
  const available = channelResearch.directories
    .filter(d => !completed.includes(d.name))
  
  // Sort by priority (high > medium > low)
  const sorted = available.sort((a, b) => {
    const priorityOrder = { high: 1, medium: 2, low: 3 }
    return priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority]
  })
  
  // Return next directory
  return sorted[0]
}

// Usage
const nextDir = getNextDirectoryTask(user, channelResearch)
// Task: "List usatom.fun on DefiLlama (30 min)"
```

#### **B. Community Tasks (Recurring)**

```typescript
function getNextCommunityTask(user, channelResearch) {
  // Get recent community engagements
  const recentEngagements = user.completedTasks
    .filter(t => t.type === 'community-engagement')
    .filter(t => isWithinDays(t.completedAt, 7)) // Last 7 days
  
  // Get communities not engaged with recently
  const availableCommunities = channelResearch.communities
    .filter(c => !recentEngagements.some(e => e.community === c.name))
    .sort((a, b) => {
      const priorityOrder = { high: 1, medium: 2, low: 3 }
      return priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority]
    })
  
  const community = availableCommunities[0]
  
  // Get engagement types not done recently
  const recentTypes = user.completedTasks
    .filter(t => t.community === community.name)
    .filter(t => isWithinDays(t.completedAt, 30)) // Last 30 days
    .map(t => t.engagementType)
  
  const availableTypes = community.engagementTypes
    .filter(type => !recentTypes.includes(type))
  
  const engagementType = availableTypes[0] || community.engagementTypes[0]
  
  return {
    community: community.name,
    platform: community.platform,
    engagementType,
    frequency: community.frequency
  }
}

// Usage
const nextCommunity = getNextCommunityTask(user, channelResearch)
// Task: "Post market insight in r/CryptoCurrency using dashboard data"
```

### **4. Dynamic Expansion (Month 2+)**

After user completes all initial directories, AI generates more:

```typescript
async function expandChannelResearch(user) {
  // Check if user completed all high + medium priority directories
  const completedCount = user.completedTasks
    .filter(t => t.type === 'directory-listing')
    .length
  
  const initialDirectories = user.channelResearch.directories
    .filter(d => d.priority === 'high' || d.priority === 'medium')
    .length
  
  if (completedCount >= initialDirectories) {
    // AI generates more directories based on:
    // - User's stage (growth = more advanced directories)
    // - Performance (which directories drove traffic)
    // - Industry trends (new platforms emerging)
    
    const additionalDirectories = await AI.generateMoreDirectories({
      industry: user.industry,
      completedDirectories: user.completedTasks.map(t => t.directory),
      stage: user.stage, // 'growth', 'scale', etc.
      performanceData: user.analytics
    })
    
    // Add to user's channel research
    user.channelResearch.directories.push(...additionalDirectories)
  }
}
```

**Example expansion for crypto dashboard:**

**Month 1 (Initial):**
- CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, DappRadar (mainstream)

**Month 2 (After completing initial):**
- AI generates: "Submit to crypto newsletters (The Defiant, Bankless)"
- "Get featured on crypto podcasts"
- "List on niche directories (Bitcoin-specific, Ethereum-specific)"

**Month 3 (Growth stage):**
- AI generates: "Partner with crypto influencers"
- "Submit to institutional directories (Messari Pro)"
- "Get listed on exchange tool sections"

## Implementation Checklist

### **Phase 1: Expand Initial Research** ✅
- [x] Update website analysis to return 10-15 directories
- [x] Update website analysis to return 10-15 communities
- [x] Add priority levels (high/medium/low)
- [x] Add engagement types for communities
- [x] Add frequency and estimated time

### **Phase 2: Rotation Logic** (Next)
- [ ] Track completed directories in user profile
- [ ] Filter out completed directories from suggestions
- [ ] Sort by priority (high > medium > low)
- [ ] Track community engagement history
- [ ] Rotate engagement types for same community
- [ ] Ensure no repeat within 7 days (communities) or ever (directories)

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Expansion** (Future)
- [ ] Detect when user completes all initial directories
- [ ] AI generates additional directories based on stage
- [ ] AI suggests partnerships, podcasts, newsletters
- [ ] AI analyzes performance and suggests more of what works

### **Phase 4: Performance Optimization** (Future)
- [ ] Track which directories drive traffic
- [ ] Suggest updating high-performing listings
- [ ] Reduce frequency for low-performing communities
- [ ] Increase frequency for high-performing communities

---

## Success Metrics

### **Before (3 directories):**
- Week 1-3: User completes all directories
- Week 4+: User has nothing new to do
- Result: Churn

### **After (10-15 directories + recurring communities):**
- Month 1: User completes 7-8 high-priority directories
- Month 2: User completes 4-5 medium-priority directories
- Month 3: User completes 2-3 low-priority directories + AI suggests more
- Ongoing: User engages in communities weekly with rotating tasks
- Result: Continuous value, no churn

---

## Bottom Line

**Old System:** 3 directories = 3 weeks of tasks = user churns
**New System:** 10-15 directories + recurring community engagement = 3+ months of tasks = user stays

**Key insight:** Directories are one-time, communities are recurring. Mix both for long-term value. 🎯
