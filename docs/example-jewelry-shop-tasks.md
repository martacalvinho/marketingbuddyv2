## Key Differences from Generic E-commerce

### **Generic E-commerce Tasks (Wrong):**
- ❌ Submit to Shopify App Store
- ❌ Post in r/shopify
- ❌ Join Shopify Community

### **Jewelry-Specific Tasks (Right):**
- ✅ List on Etsy (where jewelry buyers are)
- ✅ Post in r/jewelry, r/handmade
- ✅ Use Instagram/Pinterest (visual platforms)
- ✅ Apply to local craft fairs
- ✅ Create "making of" Reels (process content)
- ✅ Use jewelry-specific hashtags (#jewelrytok)

---

## Why This Works

1. **Platform Match:** Instagram/Pinterest/TikTok are visual (perfect for jewelry)
2. **Marketplace Match:** Etsy is #1 for handmade (not generic Shopify)
3. **Community Match:** r/jewelry, craft fairs (not r/SaaS)
4. **Content Match:** Behind-the-scenes, process videos (not SaaS demos)
5. **Audience Match:** Gift buyers, fashion lovers (not B2B buyers)

---
